# c't Downloader
This is a utility to regularly download today's issue of the [NZZ newspaper](https://www.nzz.ch) in PDF format.

It uses [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to start a Chrome-Browser instance, navigates to 
[https://https://epaper.nzz.ch/storefront/6](https://epaper.nzz.ch/storefront/6) and then 
selects the PDF version to be downloaded (unless that issue is already present in the target folder).

Thus, running this daily will make sure that you have all issues of NZZ downloaded to your destination folder 
in PDF format for your reading pleasure.
